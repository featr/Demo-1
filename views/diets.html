                    <h2>The Paleo Diet</h2>
                    <p>The paleo diet claims that modern humans should eat the same foods that their hunter-gatherer ancestors
                        ate — the way humans were genetically designed to eat before agriculture developed. The theory is
                        that most modern diseases can be linked to the Western diet and the consumption of grains, dairy
                        and processed foods. While it's debatable that this diet is comprised of the same foods your ancestors
                        ate, it is linked to several impressive health benefits.</p>

                    <h2>The Zone Diet</h2>
                    <p>The zone diet is a low-glycemic load diet on which you limit carbs to 35–45% of daily calories and protein
                        and fat to 30% each (89). It recommends eating only carbs with a low glycemic load. The glycemic
                        load (GL) of a food is an estimate of how much a food will raise your blood glucose levels after
                        eating it. It takes into account how many carbs are in the food and how much that amount will raise
                        your blood glucose levels. The Zone diet was initially developed to reduce diet-induced inflammation,
                        cause weight loss and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases (89).</p>

                    <h2>The Atkins Diet</h2>
                    <p>The Atkins diet is the most well-known low-carb weight loss diet. Its proponents state that you can lose
                        weight by eating as much protein and fat as you like, as long as you avoid carbs. The main reason
                        why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that they reduce your appetite. This causes
                        you to eat fewer calories without having to think about it</p>
